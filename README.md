Save editor for the [PC port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV_(2007_video_game)) of [Final Fantasy IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV).

**Not functional due to checksum protection when loading save files in game. There used to be a workaround, but this seems to have been patched in the November 2020 game update.**

Features:
- Ability to edit any save slot
- Character Stats and Equipment editing
- Inventory and Gil editing
- Bestiary editing
