# FFIV Save Editor
Save editor for the [PC port of Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV_(2007_video_game)), not to be confused with the PC release Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster.

**Not functional due to checksum protection when loading save files in game. There used to be a workaround, but this seems to have been patched in the November 2020 game update.**

Features:
- Ability to edit any save slot
- Character Stats and Equipment editing
- Inventory and Gil editing
- Bestiary editing
